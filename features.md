- cli terminal interface
- sum hexadecimal with binary and decimal
- multiple number representations at the same time
- binary operations
- change the number of bits used for calculating 
- customize interface with commands (show/hide history, representations) (write bash alias to hide when running (calculator --history --hex))
- inline math (should we support more than 2 operands?)
