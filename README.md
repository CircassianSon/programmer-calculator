## Programmer calculator

The programmer calculator is a simple terminal tool designed to give maximum efficiency and flexibility to the programmer working with: 

* binary, hexadecimal and decimal representations at the same time
* bitwise operations
* various operand sizes *(16bits, 32bits, 8bits, etc)*

and who likes:

* a clear, simple and customizable interface
* open source software
* terminal/cli tools

## Making of

The idea was born while developing a Nintendo Gameboy Emulator. Romes - the pitcher - found that the tools given online were clunky and did not allow for "nice multitasking"

With the constant need to visualize and manipulate bits, it became evident that a better solution had come to life
