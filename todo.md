important:
    - write features in webpage and display product
    - keep track of all features

features:

    - compare two numbers ? (perhaps change to 16 bits when comparing) (show both numbers side to side)

    - up arrow scrolls history (like terminals) - romes

    - change number of bits used

fix:
    long long + long long is being done with integers ( c integer arithmetic ), so 0xffffffff + 1 with 64 bits should be a higher number, and shouldn't become 0 as it is doing now. > fix decimal and hexadecimal number representation

    - history is broken when 2*2 is inserted 

    - if there's an operation in course, two enters should reset the calculator 

    - possibly change "n, t" operations to something else (it breaks words with them)

    - atualizar lista de operações

    - history only displays what was accepted, prettify. (i.e. askdfj = 10, help = help, + = +, 20*20 = 20 * 20, 20 *20 = 20 * 20, *20 = * 20 ) 

    no priority: 2+ when stack isn't empty should restart history & stack

    - cleanup how lines are printed (should start )
